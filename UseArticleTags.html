       <h2>Donald Trump Issues</h2>
       <h3>Gun Control, Forgeign Policy, Immegration</h3>
       <section>Unwavering support of the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
         Get serious about prosecuting violent criminals. Get gang members and drug dealers 
         off the street to make our cities and communities safer. Empower law-abiding gun
         owners to defend themselves. Expand mental health programs keep the violent mentally 
         ill off of our streets.</section>
       <section>Foreign policy will be singularly focused on Making America Safe Again by 
         destroying radical Islamic terrorist groups. End the nuclear deal with Iran and 
         the ransom payments to the world’s number one state sponsor of terrorism. America 
         will stand with its allies and end the Obama-Clinton practice of apologizing to our 
         enemies.</section>
         <section>Restore integrity to our immigration system by prioritizing the interests
         of Americans first. Enforce our immigration laws – at the border and at the 
         workplace. Build a border wall and end sanctuary cities. Send criminal aliens home.
         Welcome those who embrace our way of life, but keep out immigrants and refugees who 
         don’t through rigorous vetting.</section>

      <h2>Hilary Clinton Issues</h2>
      <h3>Gun Control, Forgeign Policy, Immegration</h3>
      <section>More than 33,000 Americans are killed by guns each year. It’s time to act.
        As President, I'll take on the gun lobby and fight for commonsense reforms to keep
        guns away from terrorists, domestic abusers, and other violent criminals—including 
        comprehensive background checks and closing loopholes that allow guns to fall into 
        the wrong hands.</section>
      <section>As secretary of state, I worked to restore America’s leadership
        in the world. As president, defending our values and keeping us safe 
        will be my top priority. That includes maintaining a cutting-edge military,
        strengthening our alliances, cultivating new partners, standing up to aggressors,
        defeating ISIS, and enforcing the Iran nuclear agreement.</section>
      <section>We need comprehensive immigration reform with a path to full 
        and equal citizenship. If Congress won't act, I'll defend President 
        Obama’s executive actions—and I'll go even further to keep families together.
        I'll end family detention, close private immigrant detention centers, and help 
        more eligible people become naturalized.</section>
